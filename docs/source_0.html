<br>

<br>
A thing can be stinky or inoffensive. <font color=#404040>[Stinky things will offend animals with strong normal senses of smell, but attract those from sulfurous or methane-heavy atmospheres.</font>]
<br>

<br>
A thing can be explored or unexplored. A thing is usually unexplored. <font color=#404040>[Explored means that the creature has already interacted with it once; it is no longer as interesting for creatures to play with.</font>]
<br>

<br>
A thing can be useful or pointless. A thing is usually useful. <font color=#404040>[Pointless means that the creature has tried to lift or eat the object and found it intractable; it will not try again.</font>]
<br>

<br>
Toughness is a kind of value. A thing has toughness. The toughnesses are sturdy, leathery, and papery. A thing is usually sturdy. <font color=#404040>[Toughness indicates the susceptibility of a thing to being eaten or destroyed by a creature.</font>]
<br>

<br>
Weight is a kind of value. The weights are light, medium-weight, or heavy. A thing has weight. A thing is usually light. <font color=#404040>[Weight indicates whether creatures of different strengths will be able to pick something up.</font>]
<br>

<br>
An electric light is a kind of device. Carry out switching on an electric light: now the noun is lit. Carry out switching off an electric light: now the noun is unlit. Carry out someone trying switching on an electric light: now the noun is lit. Carry out someone trying switching off an electric light: now the noun is unlit.
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>shine [electric light]</font>&quot; as switching on. Instead of burning an electric light, try switching on the noun. Instead of turning the lamp, say &quot;<font color=#000080>It is already positioned to shed the maximum amount of light over the room so that it is not possible to hide from it. This took some weeks of adjustments on your part, so you're disinclined to mess with it further.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>point [something] at [something]</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>shine [something] at [something]</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>turn [something] toward/towards/at [something]</font>&quot; as orienting it toward. Orienting it toward is an action applying to two things. Carry out orienting something toward something: say &quot;<font color=#000080>It's hard to see what good that would do.</font>&quot;. Instead of orienting an electric light toward the creature: try turning the noun.
<br>

<br>
Definition: a person is other if it is not the player.
