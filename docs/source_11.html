<b>Section 1 - Glue and Gluing</b>
<br>

<br>
Instead of tieing something to something, say &quot;<font color=#000080>What are you, an Eagle Scout?</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Before putting something on something when the noun fits the second noun:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try gluing the noun to the second noun instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>use [glue]</font>&quot; as a mistake (&quot;<font color=#000080>You will have to be a bit more specific about how: e.g., GLUE FISH TO ME, PUT GLUE ON COOKIE, GLUE THE DRAWER SHUT, etc.</font>&quot;)
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>use [blank label]</font>&quot; as a mistake (&quot;<font color=#000080>You will have to say how: e.g., LABEL DRAWER, WRITE EARTH ON LABEL.</font>&quot;)
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>use [filled label]</font>&quot; as a mistake (&quot;<font color=#000080>You will have to say how: e.g., LABEL DRAWER, WRITE EARTH ON LABEL.</font>&quot;)
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>use [pen]</font>&quot; as a mistake (&quot;<font color=#000080>You will have to say how: e.g., THROW PEN AT ESTHER, WRITE EARTH ON LABEL, etc.</font>&quot;)
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>use [guide]</font>&quot; as a mistake (&quot;<font color=#000080>You may look things up in the guide: for instance, CONSULT GUIDE ABOUT PERIODICITY or LOOK UP SYSTEMS IN GUIDE.</font>&quot;)
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>use [paperwork]</font>&quot; as a mistake (&quot;<font color=#000080>You may look up individual home-world files in the paperwork: for instance, LOOK UP MARS IN PAPERWORK.</font>&quot;)
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>use [a wearable thing]</font>&quot; as wearing. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>use [an edible thing]</font>&quot; as eating. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>use [an enterable container]</font>&quot; as entering.
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>label [something]</font>&quot; as labeling.
<br>

<br>
Labeling is an action applying to one thing.
<br>

<br>
Before labeling something when the player does not carry the blank label and the player does not carry the filled label:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player can see the filled label, try taking the filled label;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player can see the blank label, try taking the blank label;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player does not carry the blank label and the player does not carry the filled label, stop the action.
<br>

<br>
Carry out labeling:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the means be the blank label;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player carries the filled label, let the means be the filled label;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try gluing the means to the noun.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>

<br>
Understand the command &quot;<font color=#000080>attach</font>&quot; as something new. Understand the command &quot;<font color=#000080>stick</font>&quot; as something new.
<br>

<br>
Fitting relates things to each other. The verb to fit (it fits, they fit, it fitted, it is fitted) implies the fitting relation.
<br>

<br>
Sticking relates things to each other in groups. The verb to be stuck to implies the sticking relation.
<br>

<br>
Definition: a thing is free if it is not stuck to the egg.
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>stick [a free thing] to/on/onto [something]</font>&quot; as gluing it to. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>stick [something] to/on/onto [a free thing]</font>&quot; as gluing it to. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>stick [something] to/on/onto [something]</font>&quot; as gluing it to. Understand the commands &quot;<font color=#000080>glue</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>paste</font>&quot; as &quot;<font color=#000080>stick</font>&quot;.
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>stick [something] shut/closed</font>&quot; as gluing it shut. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>stick shut/closed [something]</font>&quot; as gluing it shut.
<br>

<br>
Understand the command &quot;<font color=#000080>attach</font>&quot; as &quot;<font color=#000080>stick</font>&quot;.
<br>

<br>
Gluing it shut is an action applying to one thing.
<br>

<br>
Before gluing an open thing shut: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not carrying the glue, say &quot;<font color=#000080>You are glue-less.</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try closing the noun; if the noun is open, stop the action.
<br>

<br>
Check gluing something shut: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is unopenable, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The noun] is already unable to be opened.</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abide by the need glue rule.
<br>

<br>
Carry out gluing something shut:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the noun to unopenable.
<br>

<br>
Report gluing something shut:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>With a long line of holdall, you glue [the noun] permanently closed.</font>&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Instead of closing a damaged unopenable container:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The noun] no longer really closes.</font>&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Instead of opening a closed unopenable container:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You can no longer open [the noun].</font>&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>

<br>
Instead of a creature trying gluing something shut when the person asked is not carrying the glue:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the person asked can see the glue, try the person asked trying taking the glue;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action.
<br>

<br>
Check a creature trying gluing something shut:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is unopenable, stop the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the person asked is not carrying the glue, stop the action.
<br>

<br>
Carry out a creature trying gluing something shut:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the noun to unopenable.
<br>

<br>
Report a creature trying gluing something shut:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Smiling to itself, [the creature] glues [the noun] permanently closed.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>

<br>
This is the need glue rule:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the glue is visible and the player is not holding the holdall glue
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try taking the glue;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not holding the glue, stop the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not carrying the holdall glue
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You need some glue before that's going to work.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
<br>

<br>
Instead of gluing the egg to the egg, try gluing the egg shut. 
<br>

<br>
Gluing it to is an action applying to two things.
<br>

<br>
Check gluing something to something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abide by the need glue rule;  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is the second noun, say &quot;<font color=#000080>Topology is against you.</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun fits the second noun, do nothing;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The noun] and [the second noun] do not belong together.</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is stuck to the second noun, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The noun] is already connected to [the second noun].</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<br>
Carry out gluing something to something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#404040>[if the egg is the noun, now the second noun is part of the egg;
<br>
</font><font color=#404040>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise now the noun is part of the egg;</font>]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is part of the second noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is stuck to the second noun.
<br>
 
<br>

<br>
Report gluing something to something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of things stuck to the egg is 2
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Meticulously, so as not to get a single drop of the stuff on yourself, you apply glue to the surfaces of [the noun] and [the second noun] and then press them together.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is visible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the creature is passive;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is playful, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[line break][The creature] watches with interest, biting its lower lip.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You carefully glue [the noun] to [the second noun].</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Instead of gluing the egg to something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try gluing the second noun to the egg.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report examining something when something is part of the noun:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Attached to [the noun] [is/are list of things which are part of the noun].</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Instead of taking something which is part of something (called the source):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>The holdall glue defeats your strength. [The noun] is now permanently attached to [the source].</font>&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Instead of gluing something to the creature:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Tempting though it may be to stick things to your little friend, you would probably be considered to be endangering its health.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Check a creature trying gluing something to something: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the person asked is not carrying the glue, stop the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is the second noun, stop the action;
<br>

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
