No one can know the truth -- that there are little green men on Earth. And blue. And purple. Even your mother thinks you've set yourself up as a Private Investigator.<p>The rest of the secret had better stay between you, your secretary Esther, and your autographed photo of Joe DiMaggio.<p>When in Rome is designed as a lunchtime game: there are five episodes, each of which may be played to a conclusion within about fifteen minutes, requiring no saves. A player may also try this episode several times if he wishes, as the puzzles are partially randomized.</font>
