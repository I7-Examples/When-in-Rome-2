<div class="about"><span><p>Manhattan, 1954.</p><p>You have just been brought on to do some special work for the Office of Alien Protocol. No one can know the truth -- that there are little green men on Earth. And blue. And purple. Even your mother thinks you've set yourself up as a Private Investigator.</p><p>The rest of the secret had better stay between you, your secretary Esther, and your autographed photo of Joe DiMaggio.</p><p>When in Rome is designed as a lunchtime game: there are five episodes, each of which may be played to a conclusion within about fifteen minutes, requiring no saves. A player may also try this episode several times if he wishes, as the puzzles are partially randomized.</p></span></div>
