A variety are provided, but we want to make sure that only a few occur per game -- otherwise they might get distracting, and besides we want to keep this stuff relatively fresh. Therefore a maximum of two encounters are allowed per playthrough, with the exception that Glue Return can happen as often as necessary. (This is because the Glue Return scene is the only way the player can get back the glue when the critter has thrown it away; all other scenes are purely ornamental.)]</span></span></p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Plot depth is a number that varies.
