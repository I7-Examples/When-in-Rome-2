<br>
<font color=#404040>[Basically an opportunity for the game to comment on particularly amusing or awkward situations that the player gets into. A variety are provided, but we want to make sure that only a few occur per game -- otherwise they might get distracting, and besides we want to keep this stuff relatively fresh. Therefore a maximum of two encounters are allowed per playthrough, with the exception that Glue Return can happen as often as necessary. (This is because the Glue Return scene is the only way the player can get back the glue when the critter has thrown it away; all other scenes are purely ornamental.)</font>]

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>At this moment her head pokes through and she gets a good look at the creature in [list of things worn by the creature]. She leans against the doorframe, grinning. 'If you think you can disguise the creature as you, you've got another think coming.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Do you mind? I'm trying to work here,' you reply, with all the dignity you can muster while reduced to [list of uppermost things worn by the player].
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>She raises her eyebrows, but goes out again. 'Don't spend all day playing with your little friend,' she says over her shoulder. 'We've got work to do in this office, you know.' </font>&quot;.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is blinded, change Esther's utterance to &quot;<font color=#000080>Esther pokes her head in on the way past your office. 'Well, for gosh sakes!' she exclaims, looking at the creature huddled out of the glare of the lights. 'What's the matter, you suspect it of being a member of the Communist party?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>You give a little jerk of the head to tell Esther to scram. She shrugs and goes out.</font>&quot;

</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>She becomes visible in the doorway[if the player is carrying something]. You move to cover yourself with [the random thing carried by the player][end if]. Her eyes go very wide, and she backs up.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'No, no, I'm so sorry,' she says, heading off whoever-it-is. 'You can't see him right now after all -- classified project -- if you even see what's going on in that room there could be repercussions...'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>You make a note to buy Esther a box of chocolates.</font>&quot;

'I've soured on this job. It's made you barmy and it's going to do the same to me if I don't take immediate action. I need a vacation. Rest and relaxation.'</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise  change Esther's utterance to &quot;<font color=#000080>Esther stands in the doorway reading a short speech which, mercifully, the egg prevents you from hearing. The gist of it from the circling motion she makes at her head would seem to be that she thinks you've gone crazy.</font>&quot;; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change Esther's utterance to &quot;<font color=#000080>Esther stands in the doorway looking over you and the alien, and the pod you're in. Then a very very strange expression crosses her face, and she goes out.</font>&quot;;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change Esther's utterance to &quot;<font color=#000080>Esther passes the door at this inopportune moment and makes one or two tart comments on the state of your house-keeping. 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'And don't think I'm staying late to tidy it up, either,' she says, on her way back to the typewriter. 'I'm meeting a couple of the girls tonight.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>As though it's ever your fault when she -- well, there was last Thursday --

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'[if the patience of Esther is 1 minute]Bring it back in just a minute[otherwise]Hang in there[end if],' she replies. The typewriter continues clacking. Right.</font>&quot;
