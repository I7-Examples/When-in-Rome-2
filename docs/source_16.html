The sampler platter is a portable supporter.  The description of the sampler platter is &quot;<font color=#000080>One of Esther's brainwaves, based on a few months of this work. If you let her, she'd probably add toothpicks and pimientoed olives.</font>&quot;  
<br>

<br>
After examining the platter when something is on the platter: say &quot;<font color=#000080>Arrayed on the platter are [a list of things on the platter].</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The scrap of wrapping paper is a papery thing on the platter. The knitted scarf is a wearable thing on the platter. The meatball is an edible thing on the platter. The meatball is stinky and fleshy. The carrot is an edible thing on the platter. The description of the carrot is &quot;<font color=#000080>It looks almost distressingly healthy: if you were an alien, you wouldn't want any part of it.</font>&quot; The description of the meatball is &quot;<font color=#000080>Fetched from the shop down the road, which is more than Esther will do for you these days. It is spiced.</font>&quot; The description of the scarf is &quot;<font color=#000080>Unattractively tartan[if we have not examined the scarf]. Esther has a variety of hideous accessories, gifts from her mother. 'She doesn't want me dating,' was Esther's response, when you dared comment[end if].</font>&quot; The description of the wrapping paper is &quot;<font color=#000080>Festive, with little snowflakes on the outside.</font>&quot;

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>You, you spend many hours within the grey walls of the Office of Alien Protocol. Your blood is tested for alien pathogens. You take memory tests and guess what cards are hidden behind a screen. You have a physical roughly once a week. You are, as you tell Esther, probably the healthiest specimen in New York City, to which she says, 'Hunh.'</font>&quot;;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[paragraph break][bold type]Tuesday, July 13, 1954[roman type] [paragraph break]'Sir--' Esther pokes her head in. 'I can bring the radio in later, if you like.' In case you're not done by 1:30, she means, when the All-Star game begins. 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Whitey Ford is starting pitcher,' you point out.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I understand the significance of this moment,' she says, withdrawing. You're making progress.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>

<br>
After going to Office:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>'Oh, and the boys said it might be getting hungry, they didn't know,' Esther calls after you. 'They fed it twenty minutes ago.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Did they say [italic type]what[roman type] they fed it?' you holler back. But she's already out of range, and the only answer you get is the clacking of the typewriter.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action.

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Esther cuts off your thinking. 'You've got a meeting in five,' she reminds you.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I know.' You watch the pod take a turn around the top of the Empire State Building and vanish from view. 'Esther, why do you think they come here, if they don't like us?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I come in to work, don't I?' she says.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Thanks, now I feel better.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Any time, boss.' Esther taps the doorframe a couple of times and goes out, leaving you to gather your thoughts before your debriefing.</font>&quot;
<br>
Deimos &quot;<font color=#000080>'After a while they all start to seem alike,' says Esther from the doorway.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'The critters? It's true that there isn't as much physiological diversity as you might reasonably expect, considering the differences between their home-worlds. I've been working on a theory that many of them actually come from the same genetic stock some way back and only diverged at a relatively recent point in their evolution... of course, I can't get the A. P. boys to confirm this for me, but it would explain a great deal. I also don't have an explanation for how they traveled between worlds when many of them still seem to be at an entirely pre-technological stage of evolution, but perhaps--'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Men. I meant men,' Esther cuts in.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Ah. Your date last night?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Disaster,' she says, peeling herself away from the doorframe. 'And I was really hoping with this one.' She gives you a little hurt smile. Poor girl.</font>&quot;
<br>
Phobos &quot;<font color=#000080>It watches out the window with resentment, and you have the distinct impression that you will see it again.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>You try to explain your concerns to the boys at the Office of Alien Protocol, but they refuse to listen. 'It's under control,' they say, and 'we know more about the political aspects of this than we can share.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Pushed very hard, one of them finally blurts, 'We have reason to believe it just wanted to take you home for dissection.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>There's a pointed silence while everyone stares at the blurt-er. They all look alike, A. P. types, but this one has a slightly rounder chin and was obviously the kid that got picked on in class.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'For science,' he adds weakly.</font>&quot;
<br>
Jupiter &quot;<font color=#000080>Esther comes in to watch it go. 'That one was bad,' she says, nodding towards [the list of visible damaged things]. 'You should make the boys bring you a tranquilizer gun.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I like doing it the old fashioned way,' you say. 'Like Daniel Boone wrassling bears.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Esther raises her eyebrows. 'I think you'd better be grateful that they land one at a time and not by transport-ship. It could be Normandy here.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Memory and imagination transpose, and you imagine short strong furry animals in the streets of Rome; swarming monkey-like over the Colosseum, up the sides of the villas, smashing the statuary. Visigoths.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>She touches your sleeve. 'Sorry,' she says. 'I didn't mean to remind you of anything.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>You shake your head. 'I wasn't in Normandy; I was in Rome, with General Clark. They threw a parade for us.' It was the fighting afterward that was bad, not Rome but the smaller towns. Not a story that Esther needs to hear.</font>&quot;
<br>
Uranus &quot;<font color=#000080>'You may not know this about me,' says Esther from the doorway. 'But I'm not very good at men.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>You raise your eyebrows, seeking a safe response. 'If you'd like me to offer an opinion on your latest beau,' you begin--
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'No, thanks!' she says, holding up a hand. 'It's the A. P. courier. I've been trying to keep him distracted, but I think he's gotten impatient. He wants you to come along right away.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Don't blame yourself.' You gather what you need for the trip. 'Those aren't men except in a very limited technical sense. I'm not sure I've ever even seen them eat anything.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I don't often see you eat anything,' she says, rallying. Yes, that's the Esther you know.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'That's because you refuse to bring me lunches from the corner,' you reply. 'But if you want to see me eat dinner, and possibly eat some yourself--'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The A. P. man, refusing to be further stalled, walks in. 'You,' he says. 'Car. Right now. Serious concern about this case. Case presenting similar symptoms turned out to be highly-- you've already sent it?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'It's headed for Uranus,' you answer brightly.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Ah.' All the tension goes out. 'Well, the boys will want to hear.'</font>&quot;
