<br>
A person has a number called the last feed time. The last feed time of a person is usually -20.
<br>

<br>
A person has a number called metabolism. The metabolism of the player is 180. 
<br>

<br>
A person has a number called breath count. The breath count of a person is usually 1000.
<br>

<br>
Definition: a person is scaly if its metabolism is 10 or less. 
<br>

<br>
Definition: a person is furry if its metabolism is 15 or more.
<br>

<br>
Definition: a person is cold:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it is not scaly, no;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it is wearing the jacket, no;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of things worn by it is less than 4, yes;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.
<br>

<br>
Definition: a person is hungry if it was last fed more than metabolism of it minutes back.
<br>

<br>
Definition: a person is starving:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it lies within the pod and the life-support is stuck to the pod and the life-support is switched on, no;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it was last fed too long ago, yes;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.
<br>

<br>
Definition: a person is dying if it was last fed way too long ago.
<br>

<br>
To decide whether (critter - a person) was last fed more than (count - a number) minutes back:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let X be the last feed time of the creature;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Y be the turn count - X;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Y &gt; count, yes;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
To decide whether (critter - a person) was last fed too long ago:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let X be the last feed time of the creature;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let count be the metabolism of the creature;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let count be count times two;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Y be the turn count - X;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Y &gt; count, yes;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
To decide whether (critter - a person) was last fed way too long ago:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let X be the last feed time of the creature;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let multiplier be 5; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the metabolism of the creature is less than ten, let the multiplier be 7;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the metabolism of the creature is greater than 30, let the multiplier be 3;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let count be the metabolism of the creature; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let count be count times multiplier; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Y be the turn count - X;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Y &gt; count, yes;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
To decide whether (critter - a person) is suffocating:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the breath count of the critter is 1000, no;
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes.
