<br>

<br>
Before exiting when the player is in a closed container (called the trap):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try opening the trap;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is in the trap, stop the action.
<br>

<br>
Instead of opening the unopenable pod when the player is in the pod:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is visible, say &quot;<font color=#000080>You bang on the door with all your might, but the holdall glue really does hold all.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Noticing your struggles, the creature waves at you cheerily.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of showing something to a creature:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try giving the noun to the second noun.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Understand the command &quot;<font color=#000080>feed</font>&quot; as something new. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>feed [something] to [something]</font>&quot; as feeding it to.
<br>

<br>
Feeding it to is an action applying to two things.
<br>

<br>
Instead of feeding something to a lightning creature: say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] very swiftly dodges your attempt to feed it.</font>&quot; Instead of feeding something to a fast creature: say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] quickly moves away before you can do this.</font>&quot; Instead of feeding something to a moderate creature when the creature is hostile: say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] watches you suspiciously and then turns its head aside.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Check feeding it to:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not carrying the noun
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is wearing the noun, try taking off the noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise try taking the noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not carrying the noun, stop the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player cannot touch the second noun, say &quot;<font color=#000080>You cannot reach [the second noun].</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Carry out feeding it to:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is delicious
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the noun to the second noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the second noun trying eating the noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] spits out [the noun].</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Accepting is an action applying to one thing.
<br>

<br>
Before a creature trying accepting something when the person asked is occupied: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of things carried by the person asked is at least the carrying capacity of the person asked, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the person asked trying dropping a random thing carried by the person asked.
<br>

<br>
Carry out a creature trying accepting something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the noun to the person asked.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Procedural rule: ignore the block giving rule.
<br>

<br>
Check giving (this is the polite refusal of unwanted objects rule): 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun does not want the noun
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the second noun trying rejecting the noun instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the second noun is passive;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Check giving (this is the no touching rule):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player cannot touch the second noun, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] cannot reach anything you might choose to give it at the moment.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<br>
Carry out giving: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the second noun trying accepting the noun.
<br>

<br>
Report giving: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] accepts [the noun][if creature is friendly] gratefully[end if][if creature is curious], poking it and turning it around and around for a moment[end if][if the creature is hostile], all but snatching it from you[end if].</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report giving something stinky to a creature when the odor sensitivity of the second noun is strong:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the second noun is passive;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] takes [the noun], at arm's length and wrinkling its nose.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report giving something stinky to a creature when the odor sensitivity of the second noun is weak:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the second noun is passive;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] takes [the noun], apparently unresponsive to its pungency.</font>&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report giving something stinky to a creature when the odor sensitivity of the second noun is inverse:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the second noun is passive;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] takes [the noun], smelling deeply and with obvious pleasure at the stinkiness.</font>&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report giving the fedora to a smart creature:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You hand over [the fedora] to [the creature], who takes by the brim and twirls it twice on the end of its claw.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>

<br>
Before giving something worn by the player to the creature:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try taking off the noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player wears the noun, say &quot;<font color=#000080>You are still wearing [the noun].</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<br>
Before the creature trying taking off something when the speed of the creature is slow:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the creature is passive;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is visible, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The creature] fumbles helplessly at [the noun], trying to remove it.</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
<br>

<br>
Report a creature trying taking off the collar when the creature is slothful:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>The creature at last manages to detach [the noun], though with considerable effort.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<br>
Report a creature trying taking off something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The person asked] removes [the noun] it was wearing.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<br>
Before doing something other than examining or looking or taking inventory or waiting when the creature is starving:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is carrying something delicious, continue the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is a thing and the player carries the noun, continue the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is a thing and the player wears the noun, continue the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is stupid, continue the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature can see the player and the player is carrying something delicious (called the treat),
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>In its eagerness for [the treat], [the creature] [if the creature is hostile]circles you, growling, so that you can't get much done[otherwise]clings so desperately to your trouser leg that you can't do much of anything[end if].</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
<br>
Every turn: if the player is poisoned, end the game saying &quot;<font color=#000080>You black out.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>

<br>
Instead of putting a wearable thing on the creature: try dressing the creature in the noun.
<br>

<br>
Collaring is an action applying to one thing. 
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>collar [something]</font>&quot; as collaring.
<br>

<br>
Check collaring: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player cannot see the collar, say &quot;<font color=#000080>You haven't even got a collar.</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not the creature, say &quot;<font color=#000080>A pointless exercise.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Carry out collaring:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try dressing the creature in the collar.
<br>

<br>
Dressing it in is an action applying to two things.
<br>

<br>
Check dressing it in: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is not wearable, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The noun] cannot possibly wear [the second noun].</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not carrying the second noun
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try taking the second noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not carrying the second noun, stop the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>

<br>
Carry out dressing it in:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun wears the second noun.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report dressing it in:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is hostile, say &quot;<font color=#000080>Your victim watches you warily and with not a little distrust, but its limbs are slow and it is unable to put up much fight. </font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You put [the second noun] on [the noun]. Very fetching.</font>&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
After dressing a hungry meaty creature in something: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The noun] suffers you to get close enough with [the second noun]; then, for your pains, bites you deeply in the forearm.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the game saying &quot;<font color=#000080>You spend most of the rest of the evening with a doctor</font>&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Instead of dressing a hungry meaty creature in something for the first time:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You get near [the noun] with [the second noun], but it grins very largely and shows you all its teeth, a sight of such menace that you draw back.</font>&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>dress [something] in [something]</font>&quot; as dressing it in. Understand the commands &quot;<font color=#000080>clothe</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>attire</font>&quot; as &quot;<font color=#000080>dress</font>&quot;.
<br>

<br>
Instead of dressing a lightning creature in something: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is blinded
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>At your approach, [the creature] squinches up its eyes.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The creature] dodges with lightning speed.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of dressing a fast creature in something: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is meaty, continue the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the creature is blinded
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>At your approach, [the creature] squinches up its eyes.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The creature] moves away too fast for you to succeed.</font>&quot;
<br>
