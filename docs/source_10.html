<br>

<br>
Esther is a woman. Esther's utterance is some text that varies. Esther's utterance is &quot;<font color=#000080>blank</font>&quot;.  
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>ask Esther [text]</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>tell Esther [text]</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>talk to esther</font>&quot; as a mistake (&quot;<font color=#000080>[if the player is in the office]The noises from Esther's office pause just long enough that you know she heard you and isn't answering[otherwise]Not really an option just now[end if].</font>&quot;) when Sending is happening. 
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>call [any thing]</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>summon [any thing]</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>shout to/for/at [any thing]</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>call to/for [any thing]</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>yell to/for/at [any thing]</font>&quot; as summoning.
<br>

<br>
Summoning is an action applying to one thing.
<br>

<br>
Carry out summoning: say &quot;<font color=#000080>There is no answer.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of summoning a timid creature: say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The creature] flinches, covering its ears.</font>&quot;
<br>
 
<br>

<br>
Instead of summoning Esther for the first time: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>'Oh, no you don't,' Esther shouts back. 'I'm not coming in there to help you even once more.'</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of summoning Esther: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You yell plaintively to Esther, but she doesn't come in.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of going nowhere from the Office: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You really can't go anywhere while the Visitor is still here to be looked after.</font>&quot; Instead of going outside from Office on Floor Fifty-One: say &quot;<font color=#000080>Not until the creature is dealt with.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Grim Hallway is a room. &quot;<font color=#000080>Months of your peculiar line of work have brought certain changes. Most of the decorations have been stripped from the walls, giving it a bare, prison-like feel. There is nothing that a particularly vicious creature could take, eat, throw, or use as a weapon. One or two patches in the plaster testify to hasty repair jobs.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Just inside is your office.</font>&quot;  The player is in Grim Hallway.
<br>

<br>
Instead of listening to the Grim Hallway: say &quot;<font color=#000080>Esther's typing is audible from the other room. It's either a very long expense report or a novella.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The potted plant is fixed in place in the Grim Hallway. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>bush</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>cactus</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>tree</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>christmas</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>spindly</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>woebegone</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>dirt</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>pot</font>&quot; as the plant. &quot;<font color=#000080>A [potted plant] lurks in the corner, perennially a little dry.</font>&quot; The description of the plant is &quot;<font color=#000080>The dirt is often useful for concealing things you need to keep from Esther: she has the duty of cleaning out your office.</font>&quot; 
<br>

<br>
Burying relates various things to various things. The verb to disguise (it disguises, they disguise, he is disguising) implies the burying relation.  Instead of digging the potted plant when the potted plant disguises something (called target): say &quot;<font color=#000080>You dig through the dirt of [the potted plant] and retrieve [the target].</font>&quot;; move the target to the player; now the plant does not disguise the target. Instead of digging the potted plant: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You don't turn up any hidden treasures this time.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of searching the potted plant: say &quot;<font color=#000080>A preliminary look turns up nothing, but you'd have to dig into the dirt to see whether anything is deeper in.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
<font color=#404040>[And because beta-testers wanted to be able to rebury things:</font>]
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>conceal [something] in [something]</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>hide [something] in [something]</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>bury [something] in [something]</font>&quot; as hiding it in. Hiding it in is an action applying to two things. Check hiding it in: if the second noun is not a container, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] will not conceal much.</font>&quot; instead; if the second noun is not openable, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] cannot be closed.</font>&quot; instead; if the player does not carry the noun, try taking the noun; if the player does not carry the noun, stop the action. Carry out hiding it in: try inserting the noun into the second noun; if the noun is in the second noun and the second noun is openable, try closing the second noun.
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>dig in [something]</font>&quot; as digging. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>dig [something]</font>&quot; as digging. <font color=#404040>[Digging is an action applying to one thing.</font>] Carry out digging: say &quot;<font color=#000080>Pointless.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Before hiding something in the potted plant when the player does not carry the noun:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player wears the noun, try taking off the noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise try taking the noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player does not carry the noun, stop the action.
<br>

<br>
Instead of hiding something in the potted plant: remove the noun from play; now the potted plant disguises the noun; say &quot;<font color=#000080>You bury [the noun] out of sight in the dirt of the potted plant.</font>&quot;.
<br>

<br>
The potted plant disguises the packet of Atomic Fireballs. 
<br>
 
<br>
Instead of waiting in the Grim Hallway: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You try postponing the inevitable, but the critter does await you inside.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of going nowhere from the Hallway, say &quot;<font color=#000080>In seems to be the operative direction here.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Office on Floor Fifty-One is inside from Grim Hallway. &quot;<font color=#000080>Your office[if the number of scenery things in the office is less than three]. Recent remodeling efforts have left it positively spacious, with only [the list of scenery things in the office] as permanent features[otherwise]. It's cramped, what with [the list of scenery things in the office], but it's got a great view down Fifth Avenue[end if].</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The window is scenery in the office. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>view</font>&quot; as the window. The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>Fair and hot, the temperatures in the eighties and the sky hazy. In short, it's a good day to be in Cleveland. You're not.</font>&quot; Instead of searching the window, try examining the window. Before opening the window: say &quot;<font color=#000080>In the normal course of things, windows on the fifty-first floor do not open.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Your particular window does, of course, since the pods have to get out somehow, but the whole thing is rigged with machinery you can't control. You've heard rumors that your predecessor sent a pod out straight through the plate glass, hospitalizing ten people from the sidewalk below. Best not to meddle.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
The desk is scenery in the Office. It is a supporter. The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>Grim, gun-metal grey, but quite sturdy, impervious to blows, and washable. All of these features have come in useful in your work.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The chair is scenery in the Office. It is an enterable supporter. The description of the chair is &quot;<font color=#000080>Made of slightly less sturdy matter than the desk, and therefore the fourth you have owned in the course of this job. You also used to have a potted cactus, but it got eaten, in an incident that did not end happily for anyone.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The file drawer is scenery in the Office. It is a container. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>drawers</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>cabinets</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>cabinet</font>&quot; as the drawer. A lot of paperwork is a thing. The file drawer is closed and openable. The autographed picture of Joe DiMaggio is on the desk. The description of the picture is &quot;<font color=#000080>He's mid-swing, and the autograph is made out to you personally.</font>&quot; Before printing the name of the file drawer: if the file drawer is damaged, say &quot;<font color=#000080>severely dented</font>&quot;.
<br>

<br>
After opening the file drawer when the file drawer contains more than five things:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You open the file drawer with a bit of struggle -- something in there is catching when you pull. But it finally comes open, and half-disgorges [a list of things in the file drawer].</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The paperwork is fixed in place. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>files</font>&quot; as paperwork. The paperwork is papery.
<br>

<br>
The description of the paperwork is &quot;<font color=#000080>Copies of previously filed forms (mostly done by your predecessor), indexed by home-world.</font>&quot; Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>papers</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>forms</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>form</font>&quot; as the paperwork. Instead of consulting the drawer about something: try consulting the paperwork about it.
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>look up [moon] in [something]</font>&quot; as researching in it about (with nouns reversed). Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>consult [something] on/about [moon]</font>&quot; as researching in it about. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>read about [moon] in [something]</font>&quot; as researching in it about (with nouns reversed). Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>read [moon] in [something]</font>&quot; as researching in it about (with nouns reversed). Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>look up [moon]</font>&quot; as researching vaguely.
<br>

<br>
Researching vaguely is an action applying to one moon. Before researching vaguely when the paperwork is in the drawer and the drawer is closed and the drawer is openable: try opening the drawer. Check researching vaguely: if the paperwork is not touchable, stop the action; Carry out researching vaguely: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You turn to your trusty paperwork...[line break]</font>&quot;; try researching in paperwork about the moon understood.
<br>
 
<br>
Researching in it about is an action applying to one thing and one moon.
<br>

<br>
Carry out researching in it about: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You find nothing of interest in [the noun].</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of researching in paperwork about a moon listed in the Table of Alien Characteristics:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let target be the moon understood;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[target]: Atmosphere -- [nostrils of target in words]; Gravity -- [mass of target]; Periodicity -- [dexterity of target in words]; Surface roughness -- [arms of target as roughness]. </font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if target is a moon listed in the Table of Paperwork Information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose row with moon column of target in the Table of Paperwork Information;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[form entry][paragraph break]</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[paragraph break]</font>&quot;;

<br>
Instead of taking the paperwork: say &quot;<font color=#000080>Esther will never forgive you if you get the files out of order. You could look up individual worlds, though, if you wanted.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The picture and the label are papery.
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>files</font>&quot; as the paperwork. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>files</font>&quot; as the file drawer when the file drawer is closed.
<br>

<br>

<br>
The lamp is a fixed in place electric light. It is switched off.  Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>light</font>&quot; as the lamp. The description of the lamp is &quot;<font color=#000080>Exceptionally bright, to help you pick out any features you might need to observe[if we have not examined the lamp]. Besides, the interrogation-office look comes in handy when you have to convince people you're a private dick. Your mother, for instance, operates under the happy delusion that you spend your days roughing up gangsters and sweating the truth out of cheating husbands[end if].</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You turn on [the lamp], casting an unforgiving glare over the whole of your office.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

Report switching on the lamp when the creature is cold: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You turn on [the lamp], casting an unforgiving glare over the whole of your office. [The creature] creeps closer to it, basking.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<br>
Report switching on the lamp when the creature is blinded: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You turn on [the lamp], casting an unforgiving glare over the whole of your office[if the creature is slothful]. The creature curls into a tight ball of misery[otherwise]. The creature backs away, blinking and whining[end if].</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<br>
The packet of Atomic Fireballs is a thing. The description of the Fireballs is &quot;<font color=#000080>The outside of the packet says ATOMIC FIREBALL with RED HOT FLAVOR. The Ferrara Pan logo is written across a cartoon atomic explosion[if we have not examined the fireballs].
<br>

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The candy is a vice you do your best to conceal: Esther would rather you took up smoking[end if].</font>&quot; The Fireballs are edible. After eating the fireballs, say &quot;<font color=#000080>You cram the candies into your mouth. For a moment it feels as though the top of your head is going to come off, but the feeling does pass.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>

<br>
The setup rules is a rulebook. 
<br>

<br>
A setup rule when the moon of the creature is Jupiter:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the lamp from play; remove the collar from play;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the shattered bits are explored;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the shattered bits are in the office. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
A setup rule: do nothing.

<br>

<br>
The X1 Probe kit is a heavy closed openable container in the Office on Floor Fifty-One. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>large</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>cardboard</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>box</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>picture</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>mars</font>&quot; as the kit. The kit is papery. It is enterable. The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>[if we have examined the kit]A[otherwise]Left for you, along with the Visitor itself, by the representatives of the Office of Alien Protocol. It is a[end if] large cardboard box containing everything you need to launch your very own alien Visitor back into space. By way of example, it has a cheery full-color telescope picture of Mars on the side.</font>&quot; After opening the Probe kit when the kit has not been open: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You pull open the top of the Probe Kit, revealing the large [pod]. 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Packed beneath it are the heavier pieces: [a propulsion unit] and [a life-support unit]. [The instruction booklet] has fallen down the side, along with [the blank label] you will need to address the probe.</font>&quot;
<br>
 
<br>
In the kit is a propulsion unit, a life-support unit, a tinted egg pod, a blank label, and an instruction booklet.
